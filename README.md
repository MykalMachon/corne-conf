## Keyboard Layout

![automatically generated layout](./docs/assets/corne_layout.svg)

This layout is automatically generated using `keymap-drawer`. If you're curious how that works, please check out the `drawer` folder.

## How do I download the firmware?

Check out the actions tab and look at the "artifacts" for each action run. 

## Where did you get your kit?

I bought my kit from [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz). The whole experience was great and their documentation, guides, and firmware made it super easy to put together.
